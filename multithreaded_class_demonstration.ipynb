    "# Multithreaded Class Demonstration Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this programming exercise, your goal is to implement a multithreaded application that demonstrates basic threading concepts in Python. Specifically, you will create two classes, `Adder` and `Subtractor`, both of which will inherit from Python's `threading.Thread` class. Additionally, a `Client` class will manage these threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. Implement the Adder Class\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Inherit from the `threading.Thread` class.\n",
    "-   Override the `run` method to print `\"I am the Adder class\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Implement the Subtractor Class\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Inherit from the `threading.Thread` class.\n",
    "-   Override the `run` method to print `\"I am the Subtractor class\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Implement the Client Class\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Create a static method named `main`.\n",
    "-   Inside the `main` method, print `\"I am the main class\"`.\n",
    "-   Initialize one instance of the `Adder` class and one instance of the `Subtractor` class, then start both threads.\n",
    "-   Ensure that the main method waits for both threads to complete before it exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Make sure your implementation correctly uses Python's threading capabilities to run `Adder` and `Subtractor` concurrently.\n",
    "-   The order in which \"I am the Adder class\" and \"I am the Subtractor class\" are printed is not deterministic and may vary on each run due to the nature of threading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The actual output may vary in order due to the concurrency involved in thread execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Ensure your Python script correctly implements the above-described functionality.\n",
    "-   Pay attention to the correctness of the threading implementation, including proper thread starting and joining.\n",
    "-   Your script will be tested for both functionality and adherence to the problem statement."
