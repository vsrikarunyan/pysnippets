    "# Point and 3D Point Classes\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a Python class hierarchy for representing points in a 2D and 3D coordinate system. The system should provide functionality for initializing and displaying the coordinates of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Point class:\n",
    "    -   Attributes:\\_x, \\_y\n",
    "    -   Methods:\n",
    "        -   **init**(self, x, y): Constructor to initialize the point's x and y coordinates.\n",
    "        -   display(self): Prints the point's coordinates in the format \\[x, y\\].\n",
    "2.  ThreedPoint class (derived from Point):\n",
    "    -   Attributes: \\_z (in addition to \\_x and \\_y inherited from Point)\n",
    "    -   Methods:\n",
    "        -   **init**(self, x, y, z): Constructor to initialize the 3D point's x, y, and z coordinates. Use `super()` to call the constructor of the base class.\n",
    "        -   display(self): Prints the 3D point's coordinates in the format \\[x, y, z\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Implement the ThreedPoint class according to the specified requirements. The Point class is already provided.\n",
    "-   Ensure that the ThreedPoint class inherits from the Point class and overrides the necessary methods."
