    "# Parallel Quicksort Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a Python implementation of the Quicksort algorithm that utilizes parallel processing to improve performance. The program should leverage the concurrent.futures module to achieve parallelism and sort an array efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should include the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  quicksort function:\n",
    "    -   Takes an array as input.\n",
    "    -   Implements the Quicksort algorithm with parallel processing.\n",
    "    -   Selects a pivot element from the array.\n",
    "    -   Partitions the array into three parts: elements smaller than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements larger than the pivot.\n",
    "    -   Creates two separate threads using ThreadPoolExecutor to sort the left and right partitions concurrently.\n",
    "    -   Waits for the left and right partitions to be sorted, and then combines the results with the middle partition (elements equal to the pivot) to form the final sorted array.\n",
    "    -   Returns the sorted array.\n",
    "2.  Example usage:\n",
    "    -   Generates a random sample array of integers.\n",
    "    -   Prints the original unsorted array.\n",
    "    -   Calls the quicksort function with the unsorted array.\n",
    "    -   Prints the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Implement the quicksort function according to the specified requirements.\n",
    "-   Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with a single element.\n",
    "-   Implement the provided example usage to demonstrate the functionality of the parallel Quicksort implementation."
