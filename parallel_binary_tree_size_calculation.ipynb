    "# Parallel Binary Tree Size Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a Python program that can calculate the size (number of nodes) of a binary tree using parallel processing. The program should leverage the concurrent.futures module and threading to achieve parallelism and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should include the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Node class:\n",
    "    -   Represents a node in the binary tree.\n",
    "    -   Has attributes: data (integer value), left (reference to the left child), and right (reference to the right child).\n",
    "2.  TreeSizeCalculator class:\n",
    "    -   Takes the root node of the binary tree and an instance of concurrent.futures.Executor as input.\n",
    "    -   Provides a method calculate\\_size to calculate the size (number of nodes) of the binary tree.\n",
    "    -   Utilizes parallel processing by submitting tasks to the executor to calculate the size of the left and right subtrees concurrently.\n",
    "    -   Waits for all tasks to complete before returning the total size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Implement the `_calculate_size_recursive` method in the TreeSizeCalculator class, which recursively calculates the size of the binary tree using parallel processing.\n",
    "-   Ensure that the `calculate_size` method properly invokes the `_calculate_size_recursive` method and handles the case when the root node is None.\n",
    "-   `_calculate_size_recursive` function doesn't return any value but should update the size property given in the constructor."
