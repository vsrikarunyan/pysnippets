    "# Student Sorting Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this challenge is to implement a Python method that sorts a list of `Student` objects. The students should be sorted primarily by their marks in ascending order, and if two students have the same marks, they should be further sorted by their names in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a basic `Student` class that includes `name` and `marks` attributes. Your task is to implement a function `sort_students` that takes a list of `Student` objects as input and returns a new list of `Student` objects sorted according to the criteria mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Student Class**: Utilize the provided `Student` class without modification. This class includes:\n",
    "-   `name`: A string representing the student's name.\n",
    "-   `marks`: An integer representing the student's marks.\n",
    "-   **sort\\_students Function**: Implement this function to sort the list of students. Use Python's built-in sorting capabilities to achieve the sorting with the specified criteria."
