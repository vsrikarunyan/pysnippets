    "# Factorial Class Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with implementing a multi-threaded solution to compute factorials of large numbers efficiently. Your implementation should involve creating a custom thread class that computes the factorial of a given number in a separate thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Factorial Thread Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Create a class named `FactorialThread` that inherits from Python's `threading.Thread` class.\n",
    "-   The `__init__` method should accept a single parameter `n`, which represents the number to compute the factorial of. It should also initialize a `result` attribute to `None`.\n",
    "-   Implement the `run` method in such a way that it computes the factorial of `n` using the `math.factorial` function and stores the result in the `result` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Compute Large Factorial Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Write a function named `compute_large_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`.\n",
    "-   Inside this function, create an instance of the `FactorialThread` class, start the thread, wait for the calculation to finish, and then return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You should use Python's `threading` and `math` modules for implementing the solution.\n",
    "2.  Pay attention to thread safety and ensure your thread correctly completes its execution before the result is accessed."
